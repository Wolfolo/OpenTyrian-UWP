# OpenTyrian-UWP
Universal Windows Platform repackaging of the game OpenTyrian

Currently does not include the assets from the game, you'll had to add those to the Assets folder and include them in the build in order for this to work.

Requires the Universal Windows (WinRT) port of SDL2, which can be found in the SDL-mirror repo here on github.

Runs decently on desktops, but also runs very well on the Xbox One, if you have it set up as a UWP Developer console.
